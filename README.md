# Caesar Encryption and Decryption

Caesar cipher was developed to communicate with supporters in a way that enemies cannot decipher in ancient years. It is a type of encryption in which each letter in plain text is replaced with a letter positioned a key number ahead of the alphabet. </br>
The purpose of our project is a code in which this encryption can be done and decrypted with the key number received from the user.

## Results
As a result of the project, we became interested in Caesar Cipher and writing encryption code.</br>
In addition, we learned how to write code with more than one person and work with a code for days and develop it.</br>
We have gained experience about what we will encounter in the projects we will do in the future.
