# Caesar Encryption and Decryption

Caesar cipher messages of enemies in wartime in ancient years
It's an encryption made not to be understood. The purpose of our project is a code in which this encryption can be done and decrypted with the key number received from the user.

## Results

As a result of the project, we became interested in Caesar Cipher and writing encryption code. In addition, we learned how to write code with more than one person and work with a code for days and develop it. We have gained experience about what we will encounter in the projects we will do in the future.
